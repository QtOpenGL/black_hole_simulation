# Black hole simulation

## Introduction
The goal of this project is a cross platform 3D-Simulation (at least linux and windows), which shall display the physical (or rather optical) relativistic effects, which occur in the environment of a black hole. This will include light deflection, gravitational effects on particles as well as red- and blue-shift, respectively.

## Building
On linux/unix systems the project can be build with qmake. Currently the build, as well as the possible resulting binaries is, or rather are, only working on linux. The current goal is to provide 'building' on linux and on windows, whereat the binaries for an operating system shall only be build on the corresponding operating system. Maybe, a cross compiling mechanism for linux to compile for windows will be added as well.
